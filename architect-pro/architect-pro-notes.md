# AWS Accounts
Consist of three discrete domains:
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Billing

By default, every AWS Account has separate billing, users and permission (**blast  radius**)  

You cannot limit permission of Root User (unrestricted permission)
Identity Store
Authorization Store


#¬†HA, Fault Tolerance (FT), DR
 - **HA**: _Ability_ to recover from the failure and minimize the outage, might be disruption
 - **FT**: _Able_ to operate during the failure, no disruption
 - **DR**: _Protecting_ the critical system data

 - **RPO**: The time between when a disaster occurs and the last recoverable copy of key business data was created (amount of data lost). Minimize the length of this time period via regular backups, snapshots, transaction logs  

 - **RTO**: The time between when a disaster occurs and when the system can be restored to an operational state and handed over to the business for testing.

# Data Persistence

 - **Ephemeral**: data is local to resource and is lost when that resource is powered down:
  - _Instance Store Volume_ (fastest type of storage available in AWS). If instance reboots, the data in the instance store persists. If instance stops, terminates or the underlying disk fails, the data is lost
  - _Amazon ElastiCache_

- **Transient**: data that exists in a form while it's passed between sources
  - _Queue_

- **Persistent**: data that is durable and survives power events
  - _EBS_
  - _EFS_

# OSI 7-Layer Networking Model
üìíhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model  

1. **Physical**
2. **Data Link**: Mac-Addresses
3. **Network**: IP-Addresses, Network Devices, Not reliable IP-protocol, no ordering
4. **Transport**: TCP (reliable) & UDP
5. **Session**: Ports, Connections
6. **Presentation**: Encryption, SSL
7. **Application**: HTTP, Application Devices

# IAM
Only two ways for user to authenticate: via username/password or via access keys - both are long-term credentials

**Real identities**: user and roles:
- have Amazon ARN
- can be referenced (e.g. in resource polices or permission policies

5000 IAM users per account limit

## Identity and Resource Policies
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html  
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html  
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html  

Mandatory elements:
 - `Statement` - contain single statement or array of individual statements
 - `Effects` (Allow, Deny)
 - `Action`/`NotAction`
 - `Resource`/`NotResource`

 Elements:
  - `Principal`/`NotPrincipal` - specify the principal that is allowed or denied to a resource. Not allowed in IAM identity-based policy, but mandatory in trust policies for IAM roles and resource-based policies
  [Principals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html) can be:
  - AWS accounts and root user
  - IAM users
  - Federated users
  - IAM roles
  - Assumed-role sessions
  - AWS services
  - Anonymous users (not recommended)

Conditions:
```json
"Condition" : { "{condition-operator}" : { "{condition-key}" : "{condition-value}" }}
```

[Variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html) (all are case-insensitive):

Available in ALL requests
- **`aws:CurrentTime`**
- **`aws:EpochTime`**
- **`aws:TokenIssueTime`**
- **`aws:PrincipalType`**
- **`aws:SecureTransport`**
- **`aws:SourceIp`**
- **`aws:UserAgent`**
- **`aws:userid`**
- **`aws:username`**
- **`ec2:SourceInstanceARN`**


## IAM Roles and Temporary Security Credentials
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html  

A role has tow components: a **trust** policy (which defines a principle and conditions under which the role can be assumed) and a **permission** policy which defines the AWS access rights granted during `AssumeRole`

A role has _no_ long-term credentials on its own. STS generates temporary credentials (min 15m to max 12h)

### AWS API Access
All interactions with AWS API signed with `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` using Sig4
`AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` map to users or roles in IAM

The _default credential provider chain_ implemented by `DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain` looks for credentials in this order:
  1. Specified in the code  
  2. Environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
  3. Default credential profile in the `~/.aws/credentials` file  
  4. Amazon ECS container credentials: loaded from ECS if environment variable `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` is set  
  5. Amazon EC2 instance role: used on EC2 instance and delivered via EC2 metadata service:
  `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<name of IAM role>`

### Revoke session
_Revoke session_ adds an additional `Deny` policy to the role with the condition:
```json
  "Condition": {
    "DateLessThan": {
      "aws:TokenIssueTime":"<current time>"
    }
  }
```

You _cannot_ revoke the existing temporary credentials, but _Revoke session_ (with the condition policy) will invalidate (with explicit Deny) all sessions with token older than the specified `aws:TokenIssueTime`

### Cross-Account Access
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-8  
üìíhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/iam-policies-and-bucket-policies-and-acls-oh-my-controlling-access-to-s3-resources/  

Cross-Account Access to S3 Buckets and Objects

ACL | Bucket Policy | IAM Role
---|---|---
ACLs is a legacy access control for S3. Access control only. Objects are _owned by the identity who PUTS them_. ACL can apply to objects! | Permission control is handled within S3. There is no IAM involved. Account who PUTS objects is the owner. Bucket policies can require the bucket owner account be the owner for objects as they are put (buy a different account) in the bucket | Objects are owned by the role in account which owns the role. Permission are managed by IAM, not S3

Scenarios for **ACL** use:
- control access to the objects
- S3 Logging (Log Delivery Group)

You can grant bucket/object access to other account (using canonical id) via ACL
**Main limitation** for ACL - all objects created by the account B in the bucket owned by account A, are owned by the account B and the account A doesn't have permission to these objects

The same situation with access via **Bucket Policy** (the objects are owned by the creator of the object and not by the bucket owner account).

To give full control to the bucket owner account, the following bucket policy should be applied to grant Cross-Account Permissions to Upload Objects While Ensuring the Bucket Owner Has Full Control:

```json
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
     {
       "Effect":"Allow",
       "Principal":{"AWS":"123456789012"},
       "Action":"s3:PutObject",
       "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::awsexamplebucket1/*"
     },
     {
       "Effect":"Deny",
       "Principal":{"AWS":"123456789012"},
       "Action":"s3:PutObject",
       "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::awsexamplebucket1/*",
       "Condition": {
         "StringNotEquals": {"s3:x-amz-acl":"bucket-owner-full-control"}
       }
     }
   ]
}
```

## Advanced Identity in AWS

### Identity Federation
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html  
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc_cognito.html  

When to use STS:
- Identity Federation:
  - Enterprise identity federation, STS supports SAML (allows use of Microsoft AD)
  - Web identity federation (Facebook, Google, Amazon) supporting OIDC (OpenID Connect)
- Roles for cross-account access
- Roles for Amazon EC2 and other AWS services
  - grant access to application running on EC2 to access other AWS services without having to imbed credentials

For mobile applications [**Cognito use is recommended**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc_cognito.html)

STS API:
- `AssumeRole`  
- `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`  
- `AssumeRoleWithSAML`  

When requested via STS API call, a credential object is returned containing:
- Session Token
- Access Key ID
- Secret Acess Key
- Expiration Timestamp

**`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`**  
1. Log into Google, ID token returned
2. Using ID tocken call STS API `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`  
3. STS provides temporary credentials
4. Use temp credentials to call AWS API

**`AssumeRoleWithSAML`**  
‚ùóPossible to have [access to AWS Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html) - SSO - (not possible with WebIdentity)

![SAML-Federation](../media/SAML-Federation.png)

![SAML-SSO](../media/SAML-SSO.png)


### IAM Permission Boundaries
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html  

Limit the maximum permissions an identity can have.
Can be applied to:
- IAM Users
- IAM Roles
- AWS Organisations (SCP)

Do not give any permissions
Used to delegate the access

**Resource-based policies** ‚Äì Resource-based policies control how the specified principal can access the resource to which the policy is attached. Within an account, an implicit deny in a permissions boundary does not limit the permissions granted by a resource-based policy. Permissions boundaries reduce permissions that are granted to an entity by identity-based policies, and then resource-based policies provide additional permissions to the entity.

**Organizations SCPs** ‚Äì SCPs are applied to an entire AWS account. They limit permissions for every request made by a principal within the account. An IAM entity (user or role) can make a request that is affected by an SCP, a permissions boundary, and an identity-based policy. In this case, the request is allowed only if all three policy types allow it. The effective permissions are the intersection of all three policy types. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow.

**Session policies** ‚Äì Session policies are advanced policies that you pass as a parameter when you programmatically create a temporary session for a role or federated user. The permissions for a session come from the IAM entity (user or role) used to create the session and from the session policy. The entity's identity-based policy permissions are limited by the session policy and the permissions boundary. The effective permissions for this set of policy types are the intersection of all three policy types.

### Policy Evaluation Logic
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html

Organisation Boundaries -> User or Role Boundaries -> Role Polices -> Permissions (Identity Polices + Resource Polices)

explicit DENY -> explicit ALLOW -> implicit DENY

# Account Management

## AWS Accounts and AWS Organisations
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilling-discounts.html  

Only one single master account in any organisation
**Master account** (root container):
- A master account is the AWS account you use to create your organization
- You cannot change which account in your organization is the master account
- Create organisations and OUs
- Invite an external account to join organisation
- Pay all charges accrued by all accounts in organisation
- **Never affected by SCP**  

Applying policies at the root level propagates them to all OUs and accounts below

Organisations operate in either **Consolidated Billing** or **All Features** mode (can be modified later)

When you create a member account in your organization, AWS Organizations automatically creates an IAM role `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` in the member account that enables IAM users in the master account to exercise full administrative control over the member account. This role is subject to any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the member account.

AWS Organizations also automatically creates a service-linked role named `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations` that enables integration with select AWS services. You must configure the other services to allow the integration.

## Service Control Policies (SCP)
similar to IAM permissions policies but SCP _don't grant any permissions_  
SCP's don't have any effect on **master** account, but for all other accounts they **impact** IAM and ROOT user

If multiple SCPs apply to an account - only the **overlap** of those SCPs is permitted

- **Allow list strategy**: explicitly specify the access that is allowed. All other access is implicitly blocked.
  By default, AWS Organisations attaches an AWS managed policy `FullAWSAccess` to all roots, OUs and accounts.
  When you restrict permissions, you _replace_ the `FullAWSAccess`
  You can't add permissions back at lower lever in the hierarchy
- **Deny list strategy**: explicitly specify the access that is not allowed. All other access is allowed.
  This is the default behavior of AWS Organisations.
  You leave the default `FullAWSAccess` policy in place and attach additional policies that explicitly _deny_ access to unwanted services and actions

# AWS Config
üìíhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-config-rules-dynamic-compliance-checking-for-cloud-resources  
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config-rules.html  

- AWS resource inventory, configuration history and configuration change notification
- Region-based
- Stores all in S3 Bucket
- Snapshot of current configuration of your account
- Can stream configuration changes to SNS
- Can trigger Lambda on Events
- Can enable rule compliance by monitoring and triggering SNS notification
- Compliance checks - periodic or triggered
- Managed Rules available (AWS Config Rules)
- You can see the timeline of changes and retrieve past configurations

AWS Config **requires IAM role** with permissions:
 - Read-only to recorded resources
 - Write to S3 logging bucket
 - Publish access to SNS

AWS Config rules can, e.g:
- Ensure that EC2 instances launched in a particular VPC are properly tagged.
- Make sure that every instance is associated with at least one security group.
- Check to make sure that port 22 is not open in any production security group.

# AWS Service Catalog
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/getstarted-iamenduser.html  

Regional service

Administrators define products and portfolios (groups of products and configurations) make them available for end users
personalised portal - deploy only approved resources that comply with organisational policies and budget constraints
- Access Control
- Enforce Standards

Portfolio - collection or grouping of products, selectively grant access
Product - definition, support contract, owner - CFN template
Add users to the portfolio
Can share portfolio cross-account or within AWS Organisations

Service Catalog Admin:
1. Create portfolio
2. Author template (CloudFormation)
3. Create product (upload the CloudFormation template)
4. Add constraints and access
8. Events from CloudFormation

need to create a `Service Catalog` service role for product cloud formation template (which creates all resources for the product, not the end users)

End Users:
5. Browse products
6. Launch products
7. Events from CloudFormation

## Virtualization and EC2 Instance Type
üìíhttps://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/

![EC2 Virtualization types](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/images/2017/ec2-types-numbered.png)

üî∏General Purpose (A, T, M)
  - M5: default instance type, general workhorse inside AWS, steady state 80-90% CPU
  - M5a: using AMD CPU
  - T*: burstable CPU performance
  - A1: Arm CPU AWS Graviton

üî∏Compute Optimized (C)
  - instances use more CPUs
  - C5
  - C5n with additional network capabilities

üî∏Memory Optimized (R, X)
  - more memory
  - X1 and X1e: the highest amount of memory

üî∏Accelerated Computing (P, Inf, G, F)
  - GPU-based instances
  - P: GPU-based general computing
  - G: graphic-intense application
  - F: customizable hardware-acceleration with FPGAs

üî∏Storage Optimized (I, D, H)
  - additional NVMe SSD-backed instance storage optimized for low latency
  - H: up to 16TB local HDD-storage
  - I: up to 60TB local NVMe SSD-storage

## Creating and using AMIs
- AMIs are objects (meta data) containing all the information required to launch an instance, the owner of AMI, launch permissions (public, explicit or implicit), the architecture and operating system and block device mapping of all volumes required.

- AMIs contain mapping to any volumes, these mappings reference EBS volume snapshots in the same region
- AMIs are regional but can be copied between regions which **also copies any volume snapshots**

When AMI created from the instance `create image`:
- Root volume snapshot created
- other volume snapshots created

By default no permissions are stored when AMI is created (implicit creator permission)
You can modify permission to be public or private (shared with specific AWS accounts)

‚ùówhen creating AMIs from instances with instance store root volumes - a **bundle** is created and stored on S3 containing ALL the root volume data

## EC2 Storage and Snapshots
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSPerformance.html
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html

Block-level storage:
- **Instance store** (local physical storage attached to hosts):
  - Temporary storage
  - High I/O and Throughput (highest I/O available in AWS)
  - volumes mapped as `ephemmeral0` to `23` (max 24 volumes)
  - included in the instance cost

  **no support for snapshots and not resilience**  

- EBS

VPC tenancy modes - Default or Dedicated
Can have only one DHCP Option set

Size from /16 to /28

Reserved IP addresses (first 4 + last):
- 10.0.0.0 - Network address
- 10.0.0.1 - VPC router
- 10.0.0.2 - DNS server address
- 10.0.0.3 - reserved
- 10.0.0.255 - broadcast address (VPC does not support broadcast)

Default VPC
- Size /16
- Default SN in each AZ size /20
- IGW
- RT with route sending all trafic to IGW
- Default SG allowing all trafic
- Default ACL allowing all traffic
- Default DHCP option

## AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)

üìíhttps://console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home#Setting  
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-az-ids.html  
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html  

Allows sharing of AWS resources between accounts

AZ-ID - **consistent** between accounts

## VPC Routing
Every VPC comes with a VPC Router, virtual device - CORE network entity responsible for routing traffic between a VPC and other networks.
The VPC router places an interface in the `Network+1` address of every subnet

Every route table starts with one rule - local route (VPC CIDR as destination and Target `local`)

- VPC endpoints use the VPC router
- VPC peering connections use the VPC router

- More specific routes take priority (/32 > /16)

## NACLs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port

Stateless security filtering
Can explicitly DENY
Rules processed in order
A SN can have **one** associated NACL
VPCs have a default NACL associated with any subnets in VPC by default
NACL does not impact traffic **inside** SN
Use NACL to limit traffic to services/resources which do not support Security Groups

## Security Groups
Attached to network interfaces
Multiple SG can be associated with an interface and a single SG cna be associated with many interfaces
**All** rules are evaluated at once, no order
There is a **default implicit DENY**
SG cannot **explicitly** deny traffic
SG can reference AWS logical resources

## Egress-Only Gateways
[IPv6 Subnetting - Overview and Case Study](https://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-documents/ipv6-subnetting-overview-and-case-study/ta-p/3125702)

Allows **outbound** only public internet and AWS Public Zone routing

## DNS in a VPC
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html  

DNS service (R53 Resolver) operates on `Network+2` IP address inside VPC - operates only inside VPC
Resolver can resolve internal DNS names to internal IP addresses (R53 private hosting zone)

**Route 53 Resolver** - regional service that lets you route DNS queries between your VPCs and your network
- Define Inbound- and Outbound-Endpoints
- Endpoints created in 2 AZ (you need 2 SG) for HA

## VPC Flog Logs
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html#flow-log-records  
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/vpc-flow-logs.html  

Flow Logs capture network flow **metadata**, not actual data flowing

```
<version> <account-id> <interface-id> <srcaddr> <dstaddr> <srcport> <dstport> <protocol> <packets> <bytes> <start> <end> <action> <log-status>
```
Protocol:
id | Protocol
---|---
1 | ICMP
6 | TCP
17 | UDP
27 | RDP

‚ùóNot logged:
- DHCP
- AWS DNS
- Metadata
- License Activation Requests

Stored in CloudWatch logs or S3 bucket
Each network interface has a unique log stream
Can be on the level:
  - VPC
  - Subnet
  - Network interface
**Not real-time** - delay of several min

FlogLogs can capture _Accepted_, _Rejected_ or _All_ types of traffic

You need to create a new IAM Role for FlogLogs

Ability to create multiple flog logs per interface (e.g. accepted, rejected or all traffic)
Launching EC2 _after_ creating flow logs will automatically create logs for each new NI

Log schema:
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS vpc_flow_logs (
  version int,
  account string,
  interfaceid string,
  sourceaddress string,
  destinationaddress string,
  sourceport int,
  destinationport int,
  protocol int,
  numpackets int,
  numbytes bigint,
  starttime int,
  endtime int,
  action string,
  logstatus string
)
PARTITIONED BY (`date` date)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ' '
LOCATION 's3://your_log_bucket/prefix/AWSLogs/{account_id}/vpcflowlogs/{region_code}/'
TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1");
```

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-troubleshooting.html

`LogDestinationNotFoundException` or `Access Denied for LogDestination` error
- Ensure that you have specified the ARN for an existing S3 bucket, and that the ARN is in the correct format
- If you do not own the S3 bucket, verify that the bucket policy has sufficient permissions to publish logs to it. In the bucket policy, verify the account ID and bucket name

`LogDestinationPermissionIssueException`:  
Amazon S3 bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size.
Each time that you create a flow log that publishes to an Amazon S3 bucket, we automatically add the specified bucket ARN, which includes the folder path, to the Resource element in the bucket's policy.
Creating multiple flow logs that publish to the same bucket could cause you to exceed the bucket policy limit.

- Clean up the bucket's policy by removing the flow log entries that are no longer needed.
- Grant permissions to the entire bucket by replacing the individual flow log entries with the following:
```
arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/*
```

## Advanced and Hybrid VPC Networking

### VPC Endpoints
allow access to AWS public services in AWS Public Zone without giving resources public Internet access
Two types of VPC endpoings:
- üî∏**Gateway endpoints**
- üî∏**Interface endpoints**

Attach VPC endpoint policy

You can create multiple endpoints in a single VPC, for example, to multiple services. You can also create multiple endpoints for a single service, and use different route tables to enforce different access policies from different subnets to the same service.

#### Gateway endpoints
Prefix list `pl-xxxxx` ([prefix list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/managed-prefix-lists.html) is representation of CIDR) added to the **route table**
Highly Available
**Not associated with SN or SG**

- S3
- DynamoDB

#### Interface endpoints
**Do not use route tables**  
- Privatelinks
- use ENI created within a **subnet and AZ** - with **a SG associated**
- (Optionally) Enable Private DNS for the endpoint to make it default for that service

Enable Private DNS name can be utilized to change the default service DNS name to use the endpoint inside VPC - removing the need for code changes

Gateway Endpoints | Interface endpoints
---|---
Do not use SG | Use SG
virtual devices | physical devices
do not use ENI | Use ENI
HA | not HA, need to be associated with SN/AZ
do not associated with SN/AZ | associated with SN/AZ
use route table | do not use route table
Do not use DNS | Use DNS. Create unique DNS names for AZ and region. Public service DNS can be resolved to private IP (private DNS must enabled)

### VPC Peering
VPC can be in another account and another region
VPC peering connections are created as logical objects and require route table entries on both sides
SG's can reference SG's in the **same** region
Process to create:
- create connection, accept on the receiving VPC side
- update RTs for requesting and receiving VPC
- update SGs/NACL if needed

All VPC peering connections are fully encrypted

üîπBy default, DNS resolves the other VPC names to public IP. You can enable DNS resolution from accepter VPC and from requester VPC - in this case names will be resolved to private IP.

### AWS Site-to-Site VPN
3 components:
1. VGW (attached to a single VPC)
2. CGW
3. VPC connection(s)


VPN connections link the VGW and CGW. They provision tunnel endpoints(2 for HA in different AZ), set authentication and define dynamic BGP or static routing. Dynamic learn remote CIDRs - static VPN must have them set

Virtual private gateways (VGW) are **logical** devices inside VPC - can be used as route targets
Customer gateways (CGW) are **physical** customer routers AND a record inside AWS for there devices. IP address and optionally ASN are provided (Allowing BGP

Different architectures:
(all have the single VGW object, HA by design)

#### No HA
Single tunnel
Single CGW

#### AWS HA
2 tunnel endpoint (in different AZs) - dual endpoint design - you need to provision two IP addresses on the customer side
Requires BGP (dynamic routing)

#### Full HA
2 VPN connections to different CGW (2), each with 2 tunnels in different AZs

### Direct Connect Architecture
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/getting_started.html  
üìíhttps://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-multiple-data-center-ha-network-connectivity  

For dedicated connections DX requires **single-mode fiber**: 1Gbps (1000BASE-LX) or 10Gbps
The network device on-prem must support BGP

1. Submit App for DX port (on DX location)
2. Connect your customer router to port on DX location
3. Create **Public** or **Private VIF** associated with VGW and
  - Public VIF allows only to contact the AWS public services **globally**
  - Private VIF is associated with VPC via VGW - **same** region

Connection over DX is **unencrypted**

‚ùóYou can use Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW) to connect CGW to multiple VGW in different VPC in different regions

### AWS Transit Gateway

üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.html

Transit Gateways have multiple route tables allowing complex routing hierarchies to be defined from true hub-and-spoke to edge consolidation and anywhere in between

Compatible with RAM (can be shared between accounts)

## KMS
üìíhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2  
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html  
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping  
üìíhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-protect-the-integrity-of-your-encrypted-data-by-using-aws-key-management-service-and-encryptioncontext/  
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html  
üìíhttps://aws.amazon.com/kms/details/#compliance  

KMS is compliant with FIPS 140-2

CMK with imported material:
- Not portable (cannot decrypt a ciphertext encrypted under a CMK by using raw key material outside of AWS KMS)
- Only symmetric CMK are supported  
- No automatic key rotation (only manual)

CMK never leave KMS and never leave a region
Access to CMK is governed by key policies

`GenerateDataKey` creates a encrypted and plaintext data key. The plaintext version is used to encrypt and then discarded. It's never stored in plaintext. The encrypted version is stored along with the encrypted data (envelop encryption).
KMS is used to decrypt the encrypted key, returning plaintext, and the data is decrypted. Encrypt and decrypt perform those functions and are handled by KMS

Key rotation can be automatic (every 3y for AWS managed CMK or once per year for customer managed) where a new backing key is added. Or they can be manual, where a new CMK is generated and an alias is changed.

Role separation with Key Policies

## AWS CloudHSM
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/initialize-cluster.html

FIPS 140-3

Dedicated HSM which runs within your VPC (via dedicated ENI) (or on-prem connected via DX, Peered or VPN), accessible only to you in a single tenant architecture.
AWS manages and maintains the hardware but has **no access** to the cryptographic component.
Interaction via _industry standards_, **no normal AWS APIs**

**No HA** unless multiple HSM's are provisioned
On-prem - if you **really need to control own physical hardware**

## AWS Certificate Manager
üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-concepts.html  

managed service providing **X509 v4 SSL/TLS certificates**. The certificates are asymmetric. One half is private and stored on resources (Servers, Load Balancers) and the other half is public.

ACM is **regional**
KMS is used - certificates are **never** stored unencrypted

Only supported on ELB, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, API Gateway

## AWS Directory Service
Group of products:
- Simple AD
- Microsoft Active Directory (AD)
- AD Connector

üìíhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-shield-use-case.html

Ingress traffic > AWS Shield > AWS WAF > Resources (CloudFront, API GW, ELB)

WebACL - rules for **allow/block/count** any traffic which matches them
**regular** or **rate-based** rules

three layers in rules:
conditions > rules > webACL

üîπwebACLs contains rules each with their own action, and a default action for any traffic not explicitly matching a rule
üîπwebACLs are processed in order and processing stops when a rule is triggered in the ACL

### AWS Shield Standard
- Always on

# EFS
- Multiple AZs
- Storage classes (Lifecycle Management):
  - Infrequent Access
  - Standard
- can apply lifecycle policies
- throughput for parallel workloads
- for on-prem servers, use **AWS DX or VPN**  
- Linux only
- 2 Performance modes (should be selected at _creation_ time):
  - **General Purpose**: ideal for latency-sensitive use cases
  - **Max I/O**: high level of aggregate throughput, but higher latency. Use for highly parallelized apps
  - monitor `PercentIOLimit`
- 2 throughput modes:
  - **Bursting**: scales as size grows
  - **Provisioned throughput**: independent of the amount of data
  - < 1TB - burst to 100MB/s
  - > 1TB - burst to 100MB/s per 1TB of data stored

‚ùóEFS Mount Targets can be accessed **only on following systems**:
- Amazon EC2 instance in local VPC
- Lambda via VPC
- EC2 instance in VPC having VPC peering with other VPC
- On-prem servers having **AWS DX** or **VPN to Amazon VPC**

‚ùóSecurity groups attached to mount target should allow inbound connection on NFS port
