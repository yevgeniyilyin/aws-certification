# AWS Landing Zone
üìíhttps://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-landing-zone/  

Help to quickly setup a secure, multi-account AWS

Components:

- _Multi-account structure_ - four accounts are deployed:
  - _AWS Organisations_ account:
    - S3 bucket and pipeline
    - account configuration StackSets
    - SCPs
    - AWS SSO
  - _Shared Services_ account
    - infrastructure shared services like AD and SSO integration in shared VPC
    - VPC can be automatically peered with new AWS accounts
  - _Log Archive_ account
    - a central S3 bucket for storing copies of all AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config files
  - _Security_ account
    - auditor (RO) role
    - administrator (full access) role
    - Amazon GuardDuty + Security Hub (master)
    - SNS security notifications
- _Account Vending Machine (AVM)_
  provided as **AWS Service Catalog** product which allows customers to create new AWS accounts in OUs preconfigured with account security baseline, and a predefined network baseline
- _Security Baseline_
  - CloudTrail
  - AWS Config
  - AWS Config Rules
  - IAM (password policy)
  - Cross-Account Access (admin access to the accounts from the security account)
  - VPC
  - AWS Landing Zone Notifications (e.g. on root account login, console sign-in failures, API authentication failures)
  - Amazon GuardDuty
- _User Access_
  - AWS SSO (with AWS SSO Directory) or
  - Federated Access to AWS Accounts
- _Notifications_
  - Aggregated security notifications (GuardDuty master)
  - Local Security Notifications

# VPC to VPC connectivity
https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/building-a-scalable-and-secure-multi-vpc-aws-network-infrastructure.pdf  

##¬†VPC Peering
No transitive routing
Max 125 peering connections per VPC
No bandwidth limits
Supports placement groups
Lowest latency
_Layer 3 IP connectivity between VPCs_  

‚ùóIf you are using VPC peering, on-premises connectivity (VPN and/or Direct Connect) must be made to each VPC. Resources in a VPC cannot reach on-premises using the hybrid connectivity of a peered VPC

VPC peering is best used when resources in one VPC must communicate with resources in another VPC, the environment of both VPCs is controlled and secured, and the number of VPCs to be connected is less than 10 (to allow for the individual management of each connection). VPC peering offers the **lowest overall cost** when compared to other options for inter-VPC connectivity

##¬†Transit VPC Solutions
Hub and spoke design
limited throughput per VPC (1.25 Gbps per VPN tunnel)
3rd party routing/networking solutions (e.g. Cisco) is running in the Transit VPC (on EC2 instances)
- Need to ensure HA/DR/FT for EC2 instances with the solution


## Transit Gateway
You can attach all hybrid connectivity (VPN or DX connections) to a single Transit Gateway
Gateway controls traffic using route tables
Regional resource, can be multiple Transit Gateway per Region
_Layer 3 IP connectivity between VPCs_  

- place your organisation's Transit Gateway in its Network Account
- Use AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a Transit Gateway for connecting VPC across multiple accounts
- **50 Gbps** bandwidth per AZ
- Transit Gateway has an hourly charge per attachment + data transfer fees

## AWS PrivatLink

![aws-privatelink](../media/aws-privatelink.png)

**Use AWS PrivateLink** when you have a client/server set up where you want:
- to allow one or more consumer VPCs _unidirectional_ access to a specific service or set of instances in the service provider VPC. Only the clients in the consumer VPC can initiate a connection to the service in the service provider VPC.
- when client and servers in the two VPCs have overlapping IP addresses as AWS PrivateLink leverages **ENIs** within the client VPC such that there are no IP conflicts with the service provider.

You can access AWS PrivateLink endpoints over VPC Peering, VPN, and AWS Direct Connect.
