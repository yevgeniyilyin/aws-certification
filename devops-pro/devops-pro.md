# VPC Network Infrastructure

## VPC to VPC connectivity
https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/building-a-scalable-and-secure-multi-vpc-aws-network-infrastructure.pdf  

###¬†VPC Peering
No transitive routing
Max 125 peering connections per VPC
No bandwidth limits
Supports placement groups
Lowest latency
_Layer 3 IP connectivity between VPCs_  

‚ùóIf you are using VPC peering, on-premises connectivity (VPN and/or Direct Connect) must be made to each VPC. Resources in a VPC cannot reach on-premises using the hybrid connectivity of a peered VPC

VPC peering is best used when resources in one VPC must communicate with resources in another VPC, the environment of both VPCs is controlled and secured, and the number of VPCs to be connected is less than 10 (to allow for the individual management of each connection). VPC peering offers the **lowest overall cost** when compared to other options for inter-VPC connectivity

###¬†Transit VPC Solutions
Hub and spoke design
limited throughput per VPC (1.25 Gbps per VPN tunnel)
3rd party routing/networking solutions (e.g. Cisco) is running in the Transit VPC (on EC2 instances)
- Need to ensure HA/DR/FT for EC2 instances with the solution


### Transit Gateway
You can attach all hybrid connectivity (VPN or DX connections) to a single Transit Gateway
Gateway controls traffic using route tables
Regional resource, can be multiple Transit Gateway per Region
_Layer 3 IP connectivity between VPCs_  

- place your organisation's Transit Gateway in its Network Account
- Use AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a Transit Gateway for connecting VPC across multiple accounts
- **50 Gbps** bandwidth per AZ
- Transit Gateway has an hourly charge per attachment + data transfer fees
- Supports both BGP and static VPN connections
- Supports VPN consolidation on a single Transit Gateway. 1.25 Gbps single-VPN tunnel bandwidth can be aggregated with ECMP

### AWS PrivatLink

![aws-privatelink](../media/aws-privatelink.png)

**Use AWS PrivateLink** when you have a client/server set up where you want:
- to allow one or more consumer VPCs _unidirectional_ access to a specific service or set of instances in the service provider VPC. Only the clients in the consumer VPC can initiate a connection to the service in the service provider VPC.
- when client and servers in the two VPCs have overlapping IP addresses as AWS PrivateLink leverages **ENIs** within the client VPC such that there are no IP conflicts with the service provider.

You can access AWS PrivateLink endpoints over VPC Peering, VPN, and AWS Direct Connect.

### Amazon VPC Sharing
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html
Sharing VPCs is useful when network isolation between teams does not need to be strictly managed by the VPC owner, but the account level users and permissions must be.
With Shared VPC, multiple AWS accounts create their application resources (such as Amazon EC2 instances) in shared, centrally managed Amazon VPCs.

## Hybrid Connectivity

Approaches:
1. **One-to-one Connectivity** - a VPN connection and/or Direct Connect private VIF is created for every VPC  
2. **Edge Consolidation** -

### VPN

![vpn-termination-options](../media/vpn-termination-options.png)

‚ùóVPN throughput to a VPC via VGW is limited to 1.25 Gbps and ECMP load balancing is not supported

### Direct Connect
Consistent, low latency, high-bandwidth dedicated fiber connectivity between customer data centers and AWS

![direct-connect-termination](../media/direct-connect-termination.png)

Connection options:
1. **Private VIFs to VGW**:  
  - up to 50 VIFs per DX connection, connecting up to 50 VPCs
  - one BGP peering per VPC
  - connectivity is restricted to the Region of DX location
2. **Private VIF to Direct Connect Gateway associated with multiple VGWs**:  
  - each VGW is attached to VPC
  - up to 10 VGWs per Direct Connect Gateway per account
  - global access
  - one BGP peering per Direct Connect Gateway per Direct Connect connection
  - not transitive via Direct Connect Gateway (north/south traffic flow only)
3. **Transit VIF to a Direct Connect Gateway associated with Transit Gateway**:  
  - up to 3 Transit Gateways over one VIF and BGP peering
4. **VPN connection to Transit Gateway over Direct Connect public VIF**:  
  - access all AWS public services and endpoints using the public IP addresses

For HA you should have at least two connections at two different Direct Connect locations (total 4 connections)
You also create VPN as a backup connectivity

## Centralized egress to internet
As you deploy applications in your Landing Zone, many apps will require outbound only internet access (for example, downloading libraries/patches/OS updates). You can achieve this preferably by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway, or alternatively an EC2 instance (configured with Source NAT(SNAT)) as the next hop for all egress internet access. Internal applications reside in private subnets, while NAT Gateway/EC2 NAT instances reside in a public subnet.

## Centralized network security for VPC-to-VPC and on-premises to VPC traffic

AWS provides **security groups** and **NACLs** to implement network security  
Both are **Layer 4** firewalls  

## DNS

![hybrid-dns](../media/hybrid-dns.png)

![hybrid-dns-centralized](../media/hybrid-dns-centralized.png)

## Centralized access to VPC private endpoints
VPCE:
- Interface Endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink)
- Gateway Endpoints

### Interface VPC endpoints
- one or more ENI with private IP (serves as entry point for traffic to a supported AWS service)
- billed by an hour the endpoint running
- create an interface endpoint in every VPC from which you want to access the AWS service (small number of VPC) **or**  
- host the interface endpoints in one centralized VPC
- can enable Private DNS (creates R53 private hosted zone PHZ) - enables resolution of public AWS service endpoint to private IP of the interface endpoint. **managed PHZ only works within the VPC with the interface endpoint**
